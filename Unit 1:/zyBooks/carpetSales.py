'''
Step 1: Read from input the carpet price per square foot (float), room width (int) and room length (int).  Calculate the room area in square feet.  Calculate the carpet price based on square feet with an additional 20% for waste.  Output square feet and carpet cost.  Submit forgrading to confirm 1 test passes.
